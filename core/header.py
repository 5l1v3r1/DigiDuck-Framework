Welcome To DigiDuckFramework!

This framework is used to install a multitude of programs to your
DigiDuck or DigiDuck compatible development boards. This has only
been tested with the DigiSpark ATTiny85 Development Board and is
made to install our database of RubberDucky Scripts or install your
own custom RubberDucky to DigiSpark Scripts on your ATTiny85 or
other compatible badUSB boards.
